	<h3>DISASSEMBLY FOR REPAIR SOP</h3>
	<p>Under the direction of the Estimator, the Disassembly Specialist disassembles the entire damaged area and blend panes to gain visual access and to the point where further disassembly will not be required in any subsequent repair stage. Throughout this stage the Estimator takes pictures showing all damage and broken hardware. The Disassembly Specialist places all removed parts (including small parts such as clips and fasteners) in an organized manner on the floor or table. Any missed operations will be marked in	yellow.</p>
	<p>The tech should flag the vehicle 20 to 30 minutes before completing the disassembly to signal that the repair plan needs to be completed.</p>
	<p>In the event that the technician has completed the disassembly process but waiting for the final	estimate, he should leave the vehicle with the flag on the window and the parts cart near the vehicle and get the next vehicle in line and begin the disassembly process.</p>

	<h4>Process Steps</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Disassembly Technician notifies the Repair Planner he/she is ready to begin disassembling a vehicle.</li>
		<li>If a vehicle is not in the Disassembly Area, Repair Planner communicates which vehicle is to be disassembled next<br>
			NOTE: All areas visually mapped in yellow must be resolved before a particular vehicle can be selected for disassembly (if not, the technician will not have clear direction as to whether a particular area should be disassembled or not)</li>
		<li>If the selected vehicle is not in the Disassembly Area, the Technician obtains the keys and moves the
			vehicle from the Staging Area into the Disassembly Area</li>
